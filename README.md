# Breast_cancer_prediction_SVM_vs_Randomfrst

This project is aimed at predicting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest. Breast cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes.

The dataset used in this project is the built-in breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn, consisting of 30 attributes extracted from breast mass images. These attributes include mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, and many others.

Utilizing this dataset, i implemented two powerful machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest. Support Vector Machines are known for their effectiveness in classification tasks, while Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and conducted a comparative analysis by training and testing both SVM and Random Forest models on the dataset. Notably, the Random Forest model was configured with 800 decision trees to ensure robustness and accuracy. The performance of each model was evaluated based on accuracy metrics.

``SVM accuracy ``
